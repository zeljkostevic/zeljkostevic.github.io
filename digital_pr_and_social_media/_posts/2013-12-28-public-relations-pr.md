In your classic agency, the public relations (PR) and marketing teams operated in different spheres. Your PR team focused on media relations -- getting the names, identities and personalities of your clients on television, in print and on the radio. On the other side of the office (literally and figuratively), your marketing people spent their time connecting your clients’ products with customers.

That approach made sense under 20th-century best practices. PR and marketing teams had different goals, tactics and techniques for how they accomplished their jobs, even working at cross-purposes if you weren’t careful.

Let’s face it -- the internet changed all of that. Customers, clients and media outlets can now search for products and companies that interest them without ever interacting with any of your traditional public relations and marketing efforts. Your agency needs to do the hard work of adapting to the new digital landscape, and it starts with aligning your PR and marketing efforts with a digital-first approach.
