Social media marketing has become increasingly popular over the past few years. No wonder this is so when approximately 2.5 billion people use social networks on a daily basis. Facebook is still the most popular social media platform, despite its recent Cambridge Analytica Scandal, with more than 1.45 billion unique daily visitors.
All this means that following the latest social media trends is essential for reaching out to your target audience and engaging them. Here are some novelties that you should keep pace with.

## User-generated content

UGC is all the rage at the moment, as companies encourage their followers to submit their images, videos, and reviews on social media. This strategy is extremely powerful when it comes to boosting customer engagement while being relatively cost-efficient. Needless to say, the fact that your social media channels are full of content provided by your followers will make your Facebook page or Instagram profile much more credible by adding that much-needed human touch. Still, your customers wonâ€™t simply start creating UGC on their own and they need a little encouragement on your part. So, you can give them a nudge by running a contest, teaming up with industry influencers, or simply by asking your followers to submit their stories.
